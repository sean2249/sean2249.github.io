### [life] Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, & Creativity

https://medium.com/@juanpabloaranovich/optimizing-workspace-for-productivity-focus-creativity-fcc0f28b6fa9

Wake up: Light the environment as much as we can. Overhead light is great.

Never do: sit down and immediately focus on something (unless you are stressed or highly motivated).

For every 45 minutes focused on something narrow, get 5 minutes of relaxing eyes (ideally, take a walk).

Make sure that whatever you are looking at is straight in front of your eyes.

If I look into a narrow space, it creates alertness but also require energy, so it’s demanding.

Lower ceiling (detailed and restricted thinking) vs higher ceiling (abstract thinking & ideas).

If you need to do analytical work, and the space is too broad or ceiling too high, you can put on a hat. It restricts the visual angle and increases focus.

Pink noise vs brown noise vs white noise: different frequencies.

It’s best to limit interruptions.

Ratio: 50% standing and 50% sitting.

### [python,docstring] Python docstring reStructuredText style

目前想用這個作為 doc-string

> https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/docstring_python.html - 看起來描述可以自動轉換成 document website 的特殊規定
